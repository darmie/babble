The Babble Language
===================

Babble is a toy language running on top of the Java Virtual Machine (in its current implementation). Its objectives are :

* to teach myself about parsing, interpreting and later on compiling a simple programming language.
* to build a simple programming language that in turn can be used to teach programming to beginners.
